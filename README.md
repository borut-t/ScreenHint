4. After validation is completed, select "Distribute App".
	- Distribute via "App Store Connect"
	- Upload the app directly to App Store Connect
	- As before, upload symbols and automatically manage signing. 
5. Go to App Store Connect and submit a new version for the app.
	- Go to https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/ and select "My Apps"
	- Select "ScreenHint"
	- By "macOS App", hit the "+" button and enter the new version number.
	- On the "Version Information" screen, enter release notes in the "What's New in This Version" field.
	- Under the "Build" section, select the "+" button and select the version you just uploaded. Walk through any questions about encryption.
	- At the top of the page, select "Save" and then "Add for Review".
	- Select "Submit for Review" to actually submit your app to the Apple review process.
